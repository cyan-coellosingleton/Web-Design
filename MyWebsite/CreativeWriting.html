            <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
            <h3>Pinned</h3>
            <p>The promise of nightfall cooled the sweltering heat of the dry Arizona landscape. The fluorescence of a brightly colored sign accompanied by the piercing eyes of a 1991 Buick broke the darkness into pieces. As fate might have it, the driver, a woman, pulled into the station. The bright neon light reflected off her skin as she got out of the car. The old building in front of her barely seemed to keep itself from toppling to the ground. In the dimness of the windows she noticed a man staring and signaling her to take the pump. She stood there noticing the constant hum of pump intruding on the deafening quiet of the dark road ahead. As the pump finished, she walked inside the building to pay.

                “Hey there” She said to the man behind the counter.
                
                “$21.73”
                
                “Right. Here’s $30. Quiet tonight, isn’t it?” She continued, trying to fill the void of the near empty shelves around her.
                
                “Yes.” He muttered counting out the change. He weakly handed her the change, his hand grazing hers in the process. She felt the coldness and stiffness of bones even in just this slight touch. Turning away, the figure walked past her into a small storage room near the rear of the store without another word. As she left the building, she noticed a small ringing around the corner.
                
                “Hey, mister? Your payphone’s ringing! Hey!” She called. No response. She walked towards the phone, unsure why, she picked up the receiver.
                
                “Hello?” No response. A dial tone. A wrong number. The woman, unconcerned, left towards her car, ready to face the darkness ahead. She continued on the road, the lights in her rearview mirror growing dimmer and dimmer.
                
                It was only her and the quiet now. As she continued her drive, she noticed a small spark of blue in the distance. Perhaps an old water bottle that had been discarded on another journey, much like hers. As she drove closer, the speck became a form, a form that instinctively drove the blood from her face. The blue buttons that were placed on the matching shirt glistened in the headlights, but piercing eyes from four feet above the ground shone brighter and stronger. The woman screamed, closing her eyes for a second, praying that the figure would not be there. Her eyes opened once again, and the empty desert filled the space in front of her. Slightly relieved, the woman began to speed up her car.
                
                She had never known her imagination to be so detailed. She could still see the lights of her car reflecting off the small figure; illuminating the strands of hair resting softly on slim shoulders. The smell of the blood dripping from the knife carved into the side of the figure seemed to loom heavily in the air. Unsure, she glanced in her rearview mirror to once again relieve her mind; but then, an ear-piercing scream. The car swerved along the road, screeching to a halt. Paralyzed in fear she shut her eyes tightly. Could she hear breathing in the backseat? Was someone there? She saw the unmistakable smile of a small figure buckled in. No. No, it had to be the wind pushing through the cracks of the window. Her imagination was doing her no favors tonight. She had to open her eyes. She couldn’t let her imagination take control. One. Two. Three. Nothing. Dust seemed to be the only occupant of her back seat. It must be the dark. It must be the quiet. It must be her imagination. Uneasy, she would speed towards the nearest lights and the life that it promised. And so, again, she drove.
                
                The speed of her car gave the woman confidence. She was going to get control of her imagination, whether it liked it or not. 25 more miles to the next station. The piercing eyes haunted her even now. 20 more miles. The silhouette of a small dress covered by a light blue sweater. 15 more miles. The way her headlights shone of her hair. 10 miles. The trusting innocent smile shifting to a questioning glare. 5. She was almost there. She just needed to see another human and she would be alright. Only a few more miles to go, she could see the faint glow of civilization. It truly was just her imagination. She sped up even more.
                
                When she reached the station, the woman bolted towards the payphone. Answer. Please answer.
                
                “Hello?”
                
                “Oh, thank God. Mark.” Never had she been so relieved to hear his voice.
                
                “Why are you calling here? I told you not to.”
                
                “Mark, please. Is everything alright? Nothing is up, right?”
                
                “Why are you asking? Are the police asking questions again? You worry way too much. There is no way anyone would think to pin it on u-“
                
                “Listen to me. Just listen. Have you checked on her recently? Is she still there?”
                
                “Are you drunk or something? Where else would she be? Seriously, I’m done with these frantic phone calls. Don’t call me again.” A dial tone.
                
                “Damnit.” The woman placed the receiver back to where it belonged. Maybe he was right. She needed to let it go. Why on earth would she see her here? In the middle of the desert? She was hidden from all prying eyes. In the backwoods by her old home. She was safe there. No one would even walk near those woods, let alone dig them up. She would be alright now.
                
                “Mom, why is it hurting? You said it wouldn’t hurt.” A voice whispered behind her.
                
                No. No. No. The woman turned slowly; eye still shut. Then a shrill scream filled the desert air.  
                
                </p>
            <h3>Starlight Eyes</h3>
            <p>The forboading night
                rises, trying to engulf
                the stars in her eyes.<br>

                Defient she fights.
                Every glimmer an attack.
                The stars shine brighter.<br>

                Victory at last!
                Bid farewell to the sorrows.
                Day finally breaks.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Mother Nature's Mortal Affinity</h3>
            <p>A lonely shape sits in solitude
                The shape long gone from our memories
                Many shifted and shaped into something unknown
                Manufactured into a sort of man-made madness
                Time never stopping to give comfort to the old
                There it sits aged and weary remembering a preceded time<br>
                
                Men walking around never noticing they have lost time
                Each standing in solitude
                Simply surviving till ‘living’ becomes old 
                Never thinking of the past or memories 
                Never noticing they live in madness 
                A time for the end unknown <br>
                
                There it sits, remembering things now unknown
                Things lost to a different time
                Things now, and forever more considered madness 
                A tree sits in solitude 
                It remembers it’s memories 
                Remembering not changing, but being old<br>
                
                Man seeing it as unwanted and old 
                The pleasures of nature to them unknown 
                Steel and industrial buildings fill their memories
                Their intelligence never growing with time 
                Each man lost in solitude
                Always only knowing the madness  <br>
                
                A tree having its own kind of madness 
                It remembers the time forgotten and old
                Once treasured by many, now in solitude
                The feeling of a caring hand unknown 
                Never changing with the time
                Always living in the memories <br>
                
                Man too has memories
                A world in peace, with no madness
                A world lost to time
                Nature and man’s friendship too old 
                A life relaxing, and carefree unknown 
                Man and tree each living in solitude<br>
                
                The relationship of man to nature far too old
                But the tree’s feeling unknown
                Waiting, and waiting till it no longer is in solitude  <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Night and Day</h3>
                <p>I sit on my porch as the last few minutes of my life comes to a close with the sun. The sun that shines happiness and hope upon us poor, pathetic humans. I, a favored human, is doomed to live in the rays of this giant star. As it droops into the horizon, I can feel my day slowly ending with it. The night coming ever closer, with evil just behind. 
                    “Leilah! Come in quickly before the sun sets completely!” My mother called from inside my house. It’s said that if a favored one comes in contact with the night, he or she will be doomed. I stumble into my house slowly, grabbing at every second I can before the giant star disappears, along with my freedom. 
                    “Do you suppose the night is really as beautiful as they say it is in books?” I wonder out loud to my parents. 
                    “Don’t be stupid, the night is filled with all things evil, and you had better keep away from it, understand?” My fathered answered from behind a newspaper, in tone saying we were done talking. 
                    I walked to my room, and turned off the lights, on my way to my bed. Even with the lights off I couldn’t imagine the outdoors at this moment, in real unmanufactured darkness, the night’s sky, filled with tiny stars trying to outshine and overtake, the night sun. How beautiful the grass must be in that sun’s light, glimmering, with the cool air surrounding each blade. How many stories I must have read on the subject of night. Some say that it must the most beautiful, elegant experience, while others say it should never be spoken of. It is law that the segmentation of day and night should never be questioned or crossed. But still the darkness calls me, and yet the division of society keeps me from it.
                    I awake from my dreams of the night, feeling empty. The darkness haunts me, I hear it speaking to me. 
                    Leilah...Leilah...Leilah...Leilah
                    It calls, and I must answer it. I walk towards my front door knowing that I will never be same again. 
                    Leilah...Leilah...Leilah...Leilah
                    I slowly turn the brass knob in my hand, and the door creaks as it opens. 
                    The.... Moon .... shines on me, I feel something, something I know is wrong, but oddly feels right. I feel myself changing, as I step into the cool night breeze. I look up to see millions of stars, sparkling their hellos. The gentle sounds of grasshoppers, fills the night air. I watch a tree as the leaves shimmer in the rays of the moon. 
                    I hear sounds I have never heard before, the night fill me with wonder. 
                    Leilah...Leilah...Leilah...Leilah
                    The sound of my name inches closer as I stand ever so still. I am all of a sudden frightened.
                    LEILAH... LEILAH...LEILAH...LEILAH
                     Suddenly my breath is stolen from me. I can’t breath. How was it that moments ago I was so free in the night breeze, but now I feel trapped. I can feel my life ending before my eyes.I try and crawl back into my house, but it’s too late. I land on my porch deck, gasping for air.  I sit on my porch, as the last few minutes of my life comes to a close with the moon.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Nope</h3>
                    <p>Here I lie on the floor, alone in an abandoned warehouse, surrounded by....pumpkins. Some might ask “Why on earth are lying on the floor surrounded by pumpkins?” While others might ask “How did I ever miss that party?” Unfortunately this was no party, for me it was the beginning of the end. You see when I was a kid, I came to a realization about myself. I was destined to be a main character. I showed all the symptoms, poor parents, no real friends, ruby red hair (Seriously, how is that even possible?), my parents had even named me Valentine. Now if that’s not a main character name then I don’t know what is. You see, there was one major problem with my destiny, I hated it. All I wanted to be was average, just someone in the crowd. And when I received a letter from a school in a place I don’t even think is real, I made my decision. I would not be a main character.
                        And that is why I joined the S.B.I.A I mean nothing life changing could happen there right? Wrong. First let’s start with my partner, James was his name, and he was the perfect guy if ever there was one. Great hair, enchanting grey eyes, tall, just all around a sickening perfect. He would walk up to you with a beautifully straight smile and say in a polite tone, “Hello, I’m James, what your name?”Of course he just had to have a British accent. Was the agency actually serious putting me as his partner? Surely a mistake was made? Why was the world against me on this? Well, either way he was not going to change my plans.  
                        It all started as another everyday mission: find a culprit, bring him in. Apparently there was a breach in security at the plant, someone had stole a box full of important documents from the company. They had captured security footage of the culprit, in, you’ll never believe it, a clown costume. First of all, who decides to break into a secure facility to steal something top secret in a bright clown costume. Seriously, time to reevaluate your life if that’s you job. 
                        “So, tell me, did anyone hear anything at the time of the robbery?”  His smooth voice asked as he scanned the crime scene with his stormy eyes. 
                        “Huh...? What? Oh! No, not a thing.” She had been staring at him. “Like I mentioned before all we have for you to go on is the surveillance tape.”
                        “Well, sounds like a dead end to me.” I said taking the tape from her hand. 
                        “Now wait just a minute Val, I think I have something.” James bent down and picked up a small circular object.
                        “A coffee bean? What good is that kind of evidence in a place like this?” I questioned in hopes he would drop his ridiculous suggestion. 
                        “It’s not an ordinary coffee bean.” He muttered while wafting the scent of the bean. “It smells of... of....Aha! Pumpkin!”  
                        At this one woman shrieked, and a couple of men caught a woman who had fainted. 
                        “You don’t mean to say that they were after...?” I asked. 
                        “Yes, I’m afraid I do.” James answered holding my shoulder. 
                        “We are doomed!” Cried a woman. “The company could never manage to continue doing business if anyone ever found out what was in that box!” 
                        “Madam, please remain calm. I assure you Val and I are sure to find the culprit.”  James said comforting the woman. Did he really just say that we would solve the case and save the company? That is exactly something I don’t want to do! I mean it’s bad enough having an extremely attractive, and brilliant partner, I didn’t want to have to save the day too!
                        “Isn’t that right, Val?” he said looking at me with a look no girl could refuse. 
                        “I guess so.” I involuntarily muttered. I mean there’s no way we could possibly be able to solve this case right? Wrong. 
                        James first went to work on the pumpkin smelling coffee bean, while he sent me to work on the surveillance tape. He came back with a lab test confirming the presence of something called Cucurbita pepo, a pumpkin only sold in one place in the city. He had acquired the key to their main warehouse.
                        “So, what did you find?” 
                        “I found that this security tape was completely useless.” I muttered knowing it was hopeless. 
                        “Well that’s all right, I’ve got all the info we need for a great lead.” He said smiling and holding his accomplishments. It was sickening how brilliant he could be. Well even if he did get the key to the warehouse, we wouldn’t be able to find anything but pumpkins there, right? Wrong.  
                        “Stay behind me at all times, we have no clue what could be hidden in there.” James said while unlocking the door to the warehouse. 
                        “Considering the fact that it is a warehouse for people that sell pumpkins, I would say it’s full of pumpkins.” I said hoping that was all we would truly find in there. Hopefully this would a dead end, and the company would go bankrupt and I wouldn’t have to save the day. 
                        “Come on!” James whispered, interrupting my thoughts.  I walked into the building, and what do you think was in it? Go on take a stab in the dark. If you were thinking pumpkins, you were wrong. Well, partially. Pumpkins were scattered everywhere, but there was something else in the middle. The man in the clown costume. Now I know you are thinking, “nope” But before you “nope” yourself into eternity, this clown didn’t actually look scary. He looked happy surrounded by pumpkins and holding the box of secrets he had stolen. Of course, James had to ruin the moment by saving the day.
                        “You’re under arrest!” He shouted tackling the stealing clown to the ground. 
                        “Let me go! Let me go!” The clown cried.
                        “At least let me explain!” He said. 
                        “Well alright, but no funny business” James said pulling his arms behind his back.
                        “Look I’m really sorry I stole from you guys, ok? But, I just could perfect my Pumpkin spice latte.”
                        “So you decided to steal from the Starbucks Intelligence Agency to get yourself a good drink?” I asked
                        “No, of course not! That would be ridiculous. Look, I’m starting my own coffee shop, “Clowning Around Coffee Shop.” Hence the costume. I don’t actually dress like this day to day you know. Well, It’s just that I have original coffee ideas, but all I ever hear about is “pumpkin spice latte this” and “Pumpkins spice latte that.” I just got tired of it. I decided that if my ideas were to be a success I would also need the ultimate Pumpkin Spice Latte.”
                        “Somehow that seems ridiculous... But I believe you were just doing what you thought was best.” I said. I wasn’t going to lie, I kind of felt sorry for him. 
                        “Well that doesn’t change the fact that he stole. Come on, it time we take a visit to the police.” James said walking towards the door. If clown man and him walked out the door, it would mean that I would be a hero. No, this could not happen. And this is where you came in, me lying on the floor surrounded by pumpkins, something I failed to mention was that I was pinning down James. The clown man had run away by the time James had realized what was happening.
                        “Val, What are you doing?!” 
                        “Taking my life into my own hands!” I shouted getting off of him and running in the same direction the clown man had run. If I was destined to have a large role in a story, I was at least going to keep my promise of not becoming a main character. Instead, I was going to a villain.

                        <p>Snuggled in blanket, maybe pink, maybe blue
                            Surrounded by future loved ones, a doctor, a midwife
                            The sounds, smells, and sensations all strange and new  
                            There we sleep, we are the miracle of life <br>
                            
                            The depreciating event of events
                            Everyone shares in the cheer 
                            Stacked on a table sit brightly colored presents  
                            Three. Two. One. Blow out another year<br>
                            
                            As we get closer and closer
                            It feels as though a bomb is about to drop   
                            Moments pass slower and slower 
                            Then we meet and they stop<br>
                            
                            Scared but comforted by our past life 
                            We remember our successes, failures, families, friends
                            A life filled happiness, hilarity, sadness, and strife 
                            We let go and then it ends<br>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Above Average</h3>
                            <p>A pressure. An expectation to uphold. One with so strong a grip that only determination can resist it. 
                                “Alright class, you all did extremely well first semester, a majority of you got a C! Well done! There were so many Ds in this class that with just a few points could have been a C, but never the less well done.” an energetic voice shouts shrouding the emptiness inside. He hands back the meaningless work, a false definition of a person’s worth, but never the less an important one. 
                                “Philp, may I speak with you in the hall please?” A dark haired boy rose hesitantly, fear resonating from his every movement. Stepping into an empty hall, away from the protection of a stranger’s eyesight, the teacher follows. Murmurs of judgement immediately attacked the silence of the sullen room.
                                “I bet he got a bad grade.” 
                                “I see him studying everyday in the library after school.” 
                                “His backpack is always as heavy as a elephant.” 
                                “He always listens during class. One day I even noticed him taking notes.” The uneasy knowledge of what was to happen filled the classroom. A count down. 
                                “I heard they are thinking of sending him to one of those schools for his level of intelligence.”
                                Three.
                                “Well I heard he never gets more than six hours of sleep because he stays up all night working.”  
                                Two. 
                                “Honestly, how hard is it to get the grade everyone gets?”
                                One. 
                                “It takes a special kind of someone to be that much of a loser.” 
                                A shriek. A quick one but it was undeniable. The door opened and the teacher walked in, sleeves rolled up and looking sullen, as though he had failed in a futile task. Then the boy. Tears rolling down his cheeks. Immediately he took his seat, face on his desk, muffled cries being shrouded by his sweatshirt. His hand crumbled a piece of paper so tightly his knuckles turned a bright red. Though misshapen and crumbled the paper was unmistakable. There it was a letter that would no doubt take an enormous part in his future. Limiting his choices, making an already ridiculously hard life harder. No doubt his parents would be upset. His mother might cry, his father might shout. Inscribed, in bright red ink for all to see, was an A+.
