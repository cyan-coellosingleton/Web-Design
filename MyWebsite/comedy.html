        <h2>Comedy</h2>
        <h3>Nope</h3>
        <p>Here I lie on the floor, alone in an abandoned warehouse, surrounded by....pumpkins. Some might ask “Why on
          earth are lying on the floor surrounded by pumpkins?” While others might ask “How did I ever miss that party?”
          Unfortunately this was no party, for me it was the beginning of the end. You see when I was a kid, I came to a
          realization about myself. I was destined to be a main character. I showed all the symptoms, poor parents, no
          real friends, ruby red hair (Seriously, how is that even possible?), my parents had even named me Valentine.
          Now if that’s not a main character name then I don’t know what is. You see, there was one major problem with
          my destiny, I hated it. All I wanted to be was average, just someone in the crowd. And when I received a
          letter from a school in a place I don’t even think is real, I made my decision. I would not be a main
          character.
          And that is why I joined the S.B.I.A I mean nothing life changing could happen there right? Wrong. First let’s
          start with my partner, James was his name, and he was the perfect guy if ever there was one. Great hair,
          enchanting grey eyes, tall, just all around a sickening perfect. He would walk up to you with a beautifully
          straight smile and say in a polite tone, “Hello, I’m James, what your name?”Of course he just had to have a
          British accent. Was the agency actually serious putting me as his partner? Surely a mistake was made? Why was
          the world against me on this? Well, either way he was not going to change my plans.
          It all started as another everyday mission: find a culprit, bring him in. Apparently there was a breach in
          security at the plant, someone had stole a box full of important documents from the company. They had captured
          security footage of the culprit, in, you’ll never believe it, a clown costume. First of all, who decides to
          break into a secure facility to steal something top secret in a bright clown costume. Seriously, time to
          reevaluate your life if that’s you job.
          “So, tell me, did anyone hear anything at the time of the robbery?” His smooth voice asked as he scanned the
          crime scene with his stormy eyes.
          “Huh...? What? Oh! No, not a thing.” She had been staring at him. “Like I mentioned before all we have for you
          to go on is the surveillance tape.”
          “Well, sounds like a dead end to me.” I said taking the tape from her hand.
          “Now wait just a minute Val, I think I have something.” James bent down and picked up a small circular object.
          “A coffee bean? What good is that kind of evidence in a place like this?” I questioned in hopes he would drop
          his ridiculous suggestion.
          “It’s not an ordinary coffee bean.” He muttered while wafting the scent of the bean. “It smells of...
          of....Aha! Pumpkin!”
          At this one woman shrieked, and a couple of men caught a woman who had fainted.
          “You don’t mean to say that they were after...?” I asked.
          “Yes, I’m afraid I do.” James answered holding my shoulder.
          “We are doomed!” Cried a woman. “The company could never manage to continue doing business if anyone ever
          found out what was in that box!”
          “Madam, please remain calm. I assure you Val and I are sure to find the culprit.” James said comforting the
          woman. Did he really just say that we would solve the case and save the company? That is exactly something I
          don’t want to do! I mean it’s bad enough having an extremely attractive, and brilliant partner, I didn’t want
          to have to save the day too!
          “Isn’t that right, Val?” he said looking at me with a look no girl could refuse.
          “I guess so.” I involuntarily muttered. I mean there’s no way we could possibly be able to solve this case
          right? Wrong.
          James first went to work on the pumpkin smelling coffee bean, while he sent me to work on the surveillance
          tape. He came back with a lab test confirming the presence of something called Cucurbita pepo, a pumpkin only
          sold in one place in the city. He had acquired the key to their main warehouse.
          “So, what did you find?”
          “I found that this security tape was completely useless.” I muttered knowing it was hopeless.
          “Well that’s all right, I’ve got all the info we need for a great lead.” He said smiling and holding his
          accomplishments. It was sickening how brilliant he could be. Well even if he did get the key to the warehouse,
          we wouldn’t be able to find anything but pumpkins there, right? Wrong.
          “Stay behind me at all times, we have no clue what could be hidden in there.” James said while unlocking the
          door to the warehouse.
          “Considering the fact that it is a warehouse for people that sell pumpkins, I would say it’s full of
          pumpkins.” I said hoping that was all we would truly find in there. Hopefully this would a dead end, and the
          company would go bankrupt and I wouldn’t have to save the day.
          “Come on!” James whispered, interrupting my thoughts. I walked into the building, and what do you think was in
          it? Go on take a stab in the dark. If you were thinking pumpkins, you were wrong. Well, partially. Pumpkins
          were scattered everywhere, but there was something else in the middle. The man in the clown costume. Now I
          know you are thinking, “nope” But before you “nope” yourself into eternity, this clown didn’t actually look
          scary. He looked happy surrounded by pumpkins and holding the box of secrets he had stolen. Of course, James
          had to ruin the moment by saving the day.
          “You’re under arrest!” He shouted tackling the stealing clown to the ground.
          “Let me go! Let me go!” The clown cried.
          “At least let me explain!” He said.
          “Well alright, but no funny business” James said pulling his arms behind his back.
          “Look I’m really sorry I stole from you guys, ok? But, I just could perfect my Pumpkin spice latte.”
          “So you decided to steal from the Starbucks Intelligence Agency to get yourself a good drink?” I asked
          “No, of course not! That would be ridiculous. Look, I’m starting my own coffee shop, “Clowning Around Coffee
          Shop.” Hence the costume. I don’t actually dress like this day to day you know. Well, It’s just that I have
          original coffee ideas, but all I ever hear about is “pumpkin spice latte this” and “Pumpkins spice latte
          that.” I just got tired of it. I decided that if my ideas were to be a success I would also need the ultimate
          Pumpkin Spice Latte.”
          “Somehow that seems ridiculous... But I believe you were just doing what you thought was best.” I said. I
          wasn’t going to lie, I kind of felt sorry for him.
          “Well that doesn’t change the fact that he stole. Come on, it time we take a visit to the police.” James said
          walking towards the door. If clown man and him walked out the door, it would mean that I would be a hero. No,
          this could not happen. And this is where you came in, me lying on the floor surrounded by pumpkins, something
          I failed to mention was that I was pinning down James. The clown man had run away by the time James had
          realized what was happening.
          “Val, What are you doing?!”
          “Taking my life into my own hands!” I shouted getting off of him and running in the same direction the clown
          man had run. If I was destined to have a large role in a story, I was at least going to keep my promise of not
          becoming a main character. Instead, I was going to a villain.
        </p>
        <h3>Above Average</h3>
        <p>A pressure. An expectation to uphold. One with so strong a grip that only determination can resist it.
          “Alright class, you all did extremely well first semester, a majority of you got a C! Well done! There were so
          many Ds in this class that with just a few points could have been a C, but never the less well done.” an
          energetic voice shouts shrouding the emptiness inside. He hands back the meaningless work, a false definition
          of a person’s worth, but never the less an important one.
          “Philp, may I speak with you in the hall please?” A dark haired boy rose hesitantly, fear resonating from his
          every movement. Stepping into an empty hall, away from the protection of a stranger’s eyesight, the teacher
          follows. Murmurs of judgement immediately attacked the silence of the sullen room.
          “I bet he got a bad grade.”
          “I see him studying everyday in the library after school.”
          “His backpack is always as heavy as a elephant.”
          “He always listens during class. One day I even noticed him taking notes.” The uneasy knowledge of what was to
          happen filled the classroom. A count down.
          “I heard they are thinking of sending him to one of those schools for his level of intelligence.”
          Three.
          “Well I heard he never gets more than six hours of sleep because he stays up all night working.”
          Two.
          “Honestly, how hard is it to get the grade everyone gets?”
          One.
          “It takes a special kind of someone to be that much of a loser.”
          A shriek. A quick one but it was undeniable. The door opened and the teacher walked in, sleeves rolled up and
          looking sullen, as though he had failed in a futile task. Then the boy. Tears rolling down his cheeks.
          Immediately he took his seat, face on his desk, muffled cries being shrouded by his sweatshirt. His hand
          crumbled a piece of paper so tightly his knuckles turned a bright red. Though misshapen and crumbled the paper
          was unmistakable. There it was a letter that would no doubt take an enormous part in his future. Limiting his
          choices, making an already ridiculously hard life harder. No doubt his parents would be upset. His mother
          might cry, his father might shout. Inscribed, in bright red ink for all to see, was an A+.
