        <h2>Horror</h2>
        <h3>Pinned</h3>
        <p>The promise of nightfall cooled the sweltering heat of the dry Arizona landscape. The fluorescence of a
          brightly colored sign accompanied by the piercing eyes of a 1991 Buick broke the darkness into pieces. As fate
          might have it, the driver, a woman, pulled into the station. The bright neon light reflected off her skin as
          she got out of the car. The old building in front of her barely seemed to keep itself from toppling to the
          ground. In the dimness of the windows she noticed a man staring and signaling her to take the pump. She stood
          there noticing the constant hum of pump intruding on the deafening quiet of the dark road ahead. As the pump
          finished, she walked inside the building to pay.

          “Hey there” She said to the man behind the counter.

          “$21.73”

          “Right. Here’s $30. Quiet tonight, isn’t it?” She continued, trying to fill the void of the near empty shelves
          around her.

          “Yes.” He muttered counting out the change. He weakly handed her the change, his hand grazing hers in the
          process. She felt the coldness and stiffness of bones even in just this slight touch. Turning away, the figure
          walked past her into a small storage room near the rear of the store without another word. As she left the
          building, she noticed a small ringing around the corner.

          “Hey, mister? Your payphone’s ringing! Hey!” She called. No response. She walked towards the phone, unsure
          why, she picked up the receiver.

          “Hello?” No response. A dial tone. A wrong number. The woman, unconcerned, left towards her car, ready to face
          the darkness ahead. She continued on the road, the lights in her rearview mirror growing dimmer and dimmer.

          It was only her and the quiet now. As she continued her drive, she noticed a small spark of blue in the
          distance. Perhaps an old water bottle that had been discarded on another journey, much like hers. As she drove
          closer, the speck became a form, a form that instinctively drove the blood from her face. The blue buttons
          that were placed on the matching shirt glistened in the headlights, but piercing eyes from four feet above the
          ground shone brighter and stronger. The woman screamed, closing her eyes for a second, praying that the figure
          would not be there. Her eyes opened once again, and the empty desert filled the space in front of her.
          Slightly relieved, the woman began to speed up her car.

          She had never known her imagination to be so detailed. She could still see the lights of her car reflecting
          off the small figure; illuminating the strands of hair resting softly on slim shoulders. The smell of the
          blood dripping from the knife carved into the side of the figure seemed to loom heavily in the air. Unsure,
          she glanced in her rearview mirror to once again relieve her mind; but then, an ear-piercing scream. The car
          swerved along the road, screeching to a halt. Paralyzed in fear she shut her eyes tightly. Could she hear
          breathing in the backseat? Was someone there? She saw the unmistakable smile of a small figure buckled in. No.
          No, it had to be the wind pushing through the cracks of the window. Her imagination was doing her no favors
          tonight. She had to open her eyes. She couldn’t let her imagination take control. One. Two. Three. Nothing.
          Dust seemed to be the only occupant of her back seat. It must be the dark. It must be the quiet. It must be
          her imagination. Uneasy, she would speed towards the nearest lights and the life that it promised. And so,
          again, she drove.

          The speed of her car gave the woman confidence. She was going to get control of her imagination, whether it
          liked it or not. 25 more miles to the next station. The piercing eyes haunted her even now. 20 more miles. The
          silhouette of a small dress covered by a light blue sweater. 15 more miles. The way her headlights shone of
          her hair. 10 miles. The trusting innocent smile shifting to a questioning glare. 5. She was almost there. She
          just needed to see another human and she would be alright. Only a few more miles to go, she could see the
          faint glow of civilization. It truly was just her imagination. She sped up even more.

          When she reached the station, the woman bolted towards the payphone. Answer. Please answer.

          “Hello?”

          “Oh, thank God. Mark.” Never had she been so relieved to hear his voice.

          “Why are you calling here? I told you not to.”

          “Mark, please. Is everything alright? Nothing is up, right?”

          “Why are you asking? Are the police asking questions again? You worry way too much. There is no way anyone
          would think to pin it on u-“

          “Listen to me. Just listen. Have you checked on her recently? Is she still there?”

          “Are you drunk or something? Where else would she be? Seriously, I’m done with these frantic phone calls.
          Don’t call me again.” A dial tone.

          “Damnit.” The woman placed the receiver back to where it belonged. Maybe he was right. She needed to let it
          go. Why on earth would she see her here? In the middle of the desert? She was hidden from all prying eyes. In
          the backwoods by her old home. She was safe there. No one would even walk near those woods, let alone dig them
          up. She would be alright now.

          “Mom, why is it hurting? You said it wouldn’t hurt.” A voice whispered behind her.

          No. No. No. The woman turned slowly; eye still shut. Then a shrill scream filled the desert air.

        <h3>Night and Day</h3>
        <p>I sit on my porch as the last few minutes of my life comes to a close with the sun. The sun that shines
          happiness and hope upon us poor, pathetic humans. I, a favored human, is doomed to live in the rays of this
          giant star. As it droops into the horizon, I can feel my day slowly ending with it. The night coming ever
          closer, with evil just behind.
          “Leilah! Come in quickly before the sun sets completely!” My mother called from inside my house. It’s said
          that if a favored one comes in contact with the night, he or she will be doomed. I stumble into my house
          slowly, grabbing at every second I can before the giant star disappears, along with my freedom.
          “Do you suppose the night is really as beautiful as they say it is in books?” I wonder out loud to my parents.
          “Don’t be stupid, the night is filled with all things evil, and you had better keep away from it, understand?”
          My fathered answered from behind a newspaper, in tone saying we were done talking.
          I walked to my room, and turned off the lights, on my way to my bed. Even with the lights off I couldn’t
          imagine the outdoors at this moment, in real unmanufactured darkness, the night’s sky, filled with tiny stars
          trying to outshine and overtake, the night sun. How beautiful the grass must be in that sun’s light,
          glimmering, with the cool air surrounding each blade. How many stories I must have read on the subject of
          night. Some say that it must the most beautiful, elegant experience, while others say it should never be
          spoken of. It is law that the segmentation of day and night should never be questioned or crossed. But still
          the darkness calls me, and yet the division of society keeps me from it.
          I awake from my dreams of the night, feeling empty. The darkness haunts me, I hear it speaking to me.
          Leilah...Leilah...Leilah...Leilah
          It calls, and I must answer it. I walk towards my front door knowing that I will never be same again.
          Leilah...Leilah...Leilah...Leilah
          I slowly turn the brass knob in my hand, and the door creaks as it opens.
          The.... Moon .... shines on me, I feel something, something I know is wrong, but oddly feels right. I feel
          myself changing, as I step into the cool night breeze. I look up to see millions of stars, sparkling their
          hellos. The gentle sounds of grasshoppers, fills the night air. I watch a tree as the leaves shimmer in the
          rays of the moon.
          I hear sounds I have never heard before, the night fill me with wonder.
          Leilah...Leilah...Leilah...Leilah
          The sound of my name inches closer as I stand ever so still. I am all of a sudden frightened.
          LEILAH... LEILAH...LEILAH...LEILAH
          Suddenly my breath is stolen from me. I can’t breath. How was it that moments ago I was so free in the night
          breeze, but now I feel trapped. I can feel my life ending before my eyes.I try and crawl back into my house,
          but it’s too late. I land on my porch deck, gasping for air. I sit on my porch, as the last few minutes of my
          life comes to a close with the moon.
